       1. Which component of the cell produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by using oxygen to remove hydrogen atoms from specific substrates in an oxidative reaction?


       a.    Lysosomes                                                              c.    Ribosomes
       b.   Peroxisomes                                                           d.    Oxyhydrosomes

        ANS: B

         Peroxisomes are so named because they usually contain enzymes that use oxygen to
         remove hydrogen atoms from specific substrates in an oxidative reaction that produces

          H2O2, which is a powerful oxidant and potentially destructive if it accumulates or escapes
          from peroxisomes. Ribosomes are RNA-protein complexes (nucleoproteins) that are

           synthesized in the nucleolus and secreted into the cytoplasm through pores in the nuclear
           envelope called *nuclear pore complexes*. Lysosomes are saclike structures that originate
           from the Golgi complex and contain more than 40 digestive enzymes called *hydrolases***,**

            which catalyze bonds in proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. Oxyhydrosomes
            are involved in enzyme production.

              1. Which cell component is capable of cellular autodigestion when it is released during cell



               injury?
               a.    Ribosome                                                                 c.    Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
               b.   Golgi complex                                                       d.    Lysosomes

                ANS: D



                 The lysosomal membrane acts as a protective shield between the powerful digestive enzymes within the lysosome and the cytoplasm, preventing their leakage into the cytoplasmic matrix. Disruption of the membrane by various treatments or cellular injury leads to a release of the lysosomal enzymes, which can then react with their specific substrates, causing *cellular self-digestion*. The other options do not correctly describe this process.

                    1. The enzyme is transcribed from DNA by RNA in the nucleus, proceeds to the ribosome for synthesis, and is transported in a secretory vesicle to the cell membrane.



                     1. The enzyme is transcribed from RNA by DNA in the nucleus, proceeds to the lysosome for synthesis, and is transported in an encapsulated membrane to the cell membrane.



                      1. The enzyme is transcribed by the mitochondria in the nucleus, proceeds to the ribosome for synthesis, and is transported in a cytoskeleton to the cell membrane.



                       1. The enzyme is transcribed from DNA by RNA in the nucleus, proceeds to the Golgi complex for synthesis, and is transported in a cytosol to the cell membrane.



                        ANS: A

                         The enzyme is transcribed from DNA by RNA in the nucleus, proceeds to the ribosome for synthesis, and is transported in a secretory vesicle to the cell membrane. The other options do not correctly describe this process.

                             ANS: B

                              The four designated phases of the cell cycle are: (1) the G1 phase (G = gap), which is the period between the M phase (M = mitosis) and the start of DNA synthesis; (2) the S phase (S = synthesis), during which DNA is synthesized in the cell nucleus; (3) the G2 phase, during which RNA and protein synthesis occurs, the period between the completion of DNA synthesis and the next phase (M); and (4) the M phase, which includes nuclear and cytoplasmic division.

                                1. What organic compound facilitates transportation across cell membranes by acting as



                                 receptors, transport channels for electrolytes, and enzymes to drive active pumps?
                                 a.    Lipids                                                                        c.    Proteins
                                 b.   Proteases                                                                  d.    Carbohydrates

                                  ANS: C



                                   Proteins act as (1) recognition and binding units (receptors) for substances moving in and out of the cell; (2) pores or transport channels for various electrically charged particles called *ions* or *electrolytes* and specific carriers for amino acids and monosaccharides; and

                                    (3)   specific enzymes that drive active pumps that promote the concentration of certain ions, particularly potassium (K+), within the cell while keeping concentrations of other ions, for example, sodium (Na+), below the concentrations found in the extracellular environment. The other options do not correctly describe this process.

                                          ANS: B

                                           Understanding the various steps involved in this process is crucial for designing drug interventions. Dysregulation of proteases features prominently in many human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative disorders. The other options do not correctly describe this process.

                                                               Chemical signaling can be classified into three categories: (1) local-chemical mediator, (2) hormone, and (3) neurotransmitter. In the local-chemical mediator model, the secreted chemical acts on the cells in the immediate environment. Hormones are used for communication with distant target cells. For example, cells can secrete a chemical and rely on the blood system to deliver the signal to a distant cell. Finally, neurotransmitters are secreted by neurons to stimulate an adjoining cell. For example, a neuron might secrete acetylcholine to stimulate the movement of a muscle cell.

In the vascular system, hydrostatic pressure is the *blood pressure* generated in vessels by the contraction of the heart. Blood reaching the capillary bed has a hydrostatic pressure of 25 to 30 mm Hg, which is sufficient force to push water across the thin capillary membranes into the interstitial space.

The osmolality will be greater than the osmolarity because of the smaller proportion of water. Osmolality is thus the preferred measure of osmotic activity in clinical assessment of individuals.

Because Na+ and K+ are both cations, the net result is an excess of anions inside the cell, resulting in the resting membrane potential. The remaining options do not correctly identify the process that most easily diffuses K+.

A net Na+ moves into the cell, and the membrane potential decreases, or *moves forward*, from a negative value (in millivolts) to zero. The Na+ gates open, and Na+ rushes into the cell, causing the membrane potential to reduce to zero and then become positive (depolarization).

They have a major role in the regulation of tissue growth and development (see Table 1-6). The remaining options do not correctly describe the role of cytokines in cell reproduction.

Cytokinesis causes the cytoplasm to divide into roughly equal parts during this phase. At the end of telophase, two identical diploid cells, called *daughter cells,* have been formed from the original cell.
